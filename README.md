Days Remaining Calculator
This simple Python script calculates the number of days remaining from the current date to a specified future date. It utilizes the datetime module to perform date-related calculations.

Usage
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Open the script in a Python environment or execute it in a terminal.
bash
Copy code
python script.py
The script will prompt you to enter the desired date directly in the code in the "YYYY-MM-DD" format.

It will then calculate and print the remaining days to the specified date.

Code Explanation
The script contains a function days_remaining that takes a date string in "YYYY-MM-DD" format as an input, converts it to a datetime object, and calculates the remaining days from the current date.

python
Copy code
from datetime import datetime

def days_remaining(from_date):
    # Convert the input date string to a datetime object
    from_date = datetime.strptime(from_date, "%Y-%m-%d")

    # Get the current date
    current_date = datetime.now()

    # Calculate the difference in days
    remaining_days = (from_date - current_date).days

    return remaining_days

# Set the desired date directly in the code (YYYY-MM-DD format)
desired_date = "2024-12-31"

# Calculate and print the remaining days
remaining_days = days_remaining(desired_date)
print(f"Days remaining to {desired_date}: {remaining_days} days")
Example
If the desired_date is set to "2024-12-31," running the script will output something like:

plaintext
Copy code
Days remaining to 2024-12-31: 666 days
Feel free to modify the desired_date variable in the code to calculate the remaining days for a different future date.
